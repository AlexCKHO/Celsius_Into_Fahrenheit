    <h3>Potential Enhancements:</h3>
    <p>
        While the current version of the converter suffices primary needs, envision future iterations with multi-scale conversions, historical data archiving, or even real-time weather data amalgamation. Such advancements could amplify the application's scalability, echoing contemporary web development paradigms.
